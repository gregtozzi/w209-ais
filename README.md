*This is my final project—completed with Emma Tebbe and Joanna Wang—from the [data visualization](https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/courses/datasci/209) course that I took as part of the UC Berkeley School of Information's [Master of Information and Data Science](https://datascience.berkeley.edu) program.  Using a government [AIS data repository](https://marinecadastre.gov/ais/), we developed a bespoke visualization of vessel traffic in San Francsisco Bay.*

We conducted EDA for this project in [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/profile/greg.tozzi#!/vizhome/vessels_underway_sf_bay_by_day_and_length/CountofVesselsUnderway) and also used Tableau for early [prototyping](https://public.tableau.com/profile/greg.tozzi#!/vizhome/vessel_density_by_length/Sheet1).

We ran through several iterations of the map design beginning with simple Matplotlib plots and moving on to D3 and D3 with Leaflet.  These are demonstrated below.  In the end, we liked the clean presentation offered by a custom basemap constructed in Mapshaper with basic annotations.  We also appreciated the ability to iterate in a notebook environment offered by the Altair/Vega-Lite stack.

Our final design was informed by several structured and recorded user tests during which we presented professional mariners with specific tasks to perform and observed their interaction with the visualzation.  We then applied the MoSCoW method to prioritze improvements.
